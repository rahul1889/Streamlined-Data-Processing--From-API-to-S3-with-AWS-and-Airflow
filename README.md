# Streamlined Data Processing: From API to S3 with AWS and Airflow
 Embark on a streamlined project to process data from the ONS API, transforming it into a structured format, and securely storing it on AWS S3

Step 1: Extract & Transform
Extract JSON data from the ONS API and transform it into a clear dataframe, ensuring each field has its own column for easy handling of diverse data types.

Step 2: EC2 & Airflow Setup
Demystify EC2 setup, install dependencies, and Airflow on the command line. Upload your Python code to Airflow, creating simple yet effective DAGs for automation.

Step 3: S3 Integration
Create an S3 bucket on AWS, a secure home for processed data. Connect your Python code to effortlessly store the dataframe as a CSV file directly into S3 for security and accessibility.

Step 4: Rigorous Testing
Ensure reliability by rigorously testing the entire data pipeline, executing it multiple times to guarantee seamless automation at every stage.
